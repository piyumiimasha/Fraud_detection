This study employs machine learning techniques to predict credit charge-offs while addressing the challenges of class imbalance. 
A thorough exploratory data analysis identified key predictors such as FICO scores, delinquency status, and unusual submission patterns. 
Correlation analysis revealed significant relationships among features, and feature selection via Chi-Square tests emphasized categorical predictors. 
Logistic regression with balanced class weights emerged as the top-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 86%. 
The modelâ€™s coefficients provided interpretability, while generated risk scores offered practical applicability. This analysis demonstrates the integration of statistical insights and predictive modeling to support data-driven decision-making in credit risk assessment.
